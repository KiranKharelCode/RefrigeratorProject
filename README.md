# RefrigeratorProject
 A project to help me keep track of the items in my fridge

The problem:
I waste alot of food, because I forget it's in my fridge. Or I forget to use it all
after using it for 1 or 2 recipes. In order to save me money in the future and to 
limit my waste, I have coded this simple program to keep track of my food. 
With the help of Twillio API and an AI API, I can get all the data of my 
refrigerator. 
Data like; how many of an item I have, when I had bought it, how long it's been on my fridge,
and the data on how long that item can be stored in the fridge.
